SITS: Simple Issue Tracking System
===

SITS is a simple tool for tracking IT issues. There are many great and simple stand-alone bug tracking systems out there but they are geared mostly toward programing projects. It seems that most of the generic IT issue trackers exist as part of larger, more comprehensive infrastructures. SITS is lightweight, simple and generic making it easy to adapt to any setting.
